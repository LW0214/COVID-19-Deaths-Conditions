# Conclusion

As we conclude our exploration, we reflect on the insights gained and their broader implications. This report, utilizing the data from the National Center for Health Statistics and CDC Wonder, broke down the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic through various angles: trends over time, geographical variations, age-related vulnerabilities, and the impact of specific health conditions.

**Key Takeaways**

1.  Trend Analysis: Our time series analysis revealed fluctuations in COVID-19 mortality rates, with noticeable seasonal patterns. Specifically, we saw that deaths tend to rise in winter and summer months.

2.  Geographical Insights: The geographical analysis highlighted regional disparities in COVID-19 impact, indicating the influence of healthcare infrastructure and public health policies. An interesting observation was the consistent low death rates in Vermont, suggesting effective local health measures.

3.  Age-Related Findings: The data illustrated the varying impacts of COVID-19 across different age brackets, with older populations being more vulnerable. This highlights the necessity for age-tailored health strategies and protective measures.

4.  Health Conditions and Mortality: Analyzing health conditions, we found that conditions like respiratory diseases, hypertensive diseases and diabetes were closely linked with higher COVID-19 mortality rates. This highlights the need for targeted medical interventions for high-risk groups.

**Limitations**

1.  Data Completeness: Our analysis may not fully capture unreported or misclassified COVID-19 deaths, especially in the case of provisional data for 2022 and 2023.

2.  Comorbidity Reporting: The data on comorbidities is dependent on the accuracy of medical reporting. Inconsistent documentation across jurisdictions may have led to under or overestimation of certain health conditions\' impact.

3.  Temporal Delays: The lag in data reporting, particularly for recent years, may have affected the timeliness and relevance of our findings.

4.  Population Data Constraints: Our analysis utilized yearly population data that was recorded as of July 1st each year. However, our mortality analysis spanned from January to December annually. This discrepancy in the timeframes means that the population figures may not accurately reflect the true population at the time of each death.

**Future Directions**

1.  Intra-State Analysis: While the project covered variations within states, such as urban vs. rural differences could be further explored.

2.  Global Comparison: Expanding the analysis to include other countries would allow for a better understanding of how different healthcare systems and policies have influenced COVID-19 outcomes.

3.  Vaccine Impact Study: A study on the impact of vaccination on mortality rates, especially among older groups, could offer more insights for future public health initiatives.

**Lessons Learned**

Throughout this exploration, we learned about the many contributors to COVID-19 death rate, namely age, geographical location, and conditions, and the interesting interaction effects between them, for example the prevalence of diabetes in young age groups.

This exploration also unravelled patterns that we've never dwelt on before aobut COVID-19. For example, it seems reasonable to assume that COVID-19 will be more prevalent in states with a higher population density like New York, especially in the year when COVID-19 first broke out. Yet interestingly in 2021, the pattern of state-wise COVID-19 death features a shift between Northern and Southern states, where Northern states generally improve while Southern state aggravates. Whether this phenomenon is due to any shared public health practices and community awareness in Northern or Sourthern states requires future analysis.

It is interesting how the COVID-19 death counts of most conditions are positively correlated through time, suggesting the presence of comorbidity, which will be interesting for future analysis.
 
Last but not least, we learned about how different visualization graphs can aid with analysis and interpretation of the topic in different ways. For example, time series line chart is adept at showing macroscopic trends, while interactive D3 graphs can depict the microscopic changes between 2 time periods with the aid of animation.
